            <p>Hello, world. I am so excited - and a bit nervous - to be making my first book review. 
                Perhaps maybe one person will read this, to which I applaud you. On one hand I am a bit scared that I am
                posting something on a public website for the first time, but the other hand tells me that not that many
                people are actually going to stumble across this lmao. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ready Player One is an exciting YA science fiction novel written by Robert Cline. In this breathaking and 
                    immersive world - both in and out of game - as well as rich characters, storyline, and action will leave you
                    on the edge of your seat. I know it did for me. 
                </p>

                The story revolves around Wade Watts, a young adult who is obsessed with The Oasis to escape the impoverished
                world he lives in and his trailer park skyscraper neighborhood known as The Stacks. If you watched the anime Sword
                Art Online, you will probably know the jist of what I am about to say. The Oasis is a virtual universe 
                that is covered in many planets all with their different functions such as schooling, commerce, and 
                rooming. His love for the Oasis intensifies as The Creator of The Oasis, Halliday, creates an 80s' themed treasure hunt
                challenge for Oasis users the chance to become millionares, a majority stake within the Oasis company, the owners of The Oasis. Wade Watts - also known
                by the username Parzival - along with fellow players Aech, Art3mis, Shoto, and Daito to come together as friends
                but also as challengers to win the Halliday puzzle. Throw in the fact that the internet service provider for the Oasis
                IOI - pronounced 'eye oh eye' - are sending their own employees to win the game themselves to gain control 
                of the Oasis, and you 'Hit Start' on Clines' adventure.

            <h5>
                Spoilers:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Without a doubt this is my favorite fiction book of all time, and possibly favorite book of all time. 
                I am a Gen X stuck in a Gen Z body, because I remember 'growing up in the 80s'. When I was a kid I was obcessed with Ghostbusters
                and Back To The Future, played many arcade machines in the bowling alleys I frequented, and listened to 80s' hits
                on the radio non-stop growing up. This book plays not only tribute to 80s' pop culture, but uses 
                their 80s' triva to advance their plot. I laughed when there was a chapter just about recreating the movie
                War Games after I watched it twice, I fell in love with the 'soundtrack' of the book when they played
                Belinda Castille when they dances, and I died when the peak of the action rested on how good Wade and his friends
                recreating Monty Phython and the Holy Grail. Nee! 
            </p>
            <p>
                But the most loved about the book was how memorable the characters were. I believe that science fiction
                - despite it being made-up - is the best genre we as a society have to highlight truth. My draw dropped when 
                Aech was an large black woman when all this time she was the exact opposite in her depiction in the Oasis despite
                her warning Wade, and in turn the audience, that she could not be what she looks like. My heart sunk when 
                she said she turned to The Oasis to avoid the pain of being an overweight black woman growing up. I felt the same when I realized 
                that Art3mis had been relying on The Oasis to hide her birthmark so she could feel pretty. And Watts used The Oasis to escape from a 
                impoverished world. My heart yearns to meet these characters, even 5 months after I read the book I still think of them. 
                I want to be their friends as all of them were relying on technology so they could feel like they could have a sense
                of little worry through escapism. And I feel like they speak to all of us, how we all feel so insecure about
                ourselves through our backrounds of ethnicity, body size, socio-economic standing, etc. The use of tech, especailly the
                internet, has anonamized us to the point where we rely on it to escape the cruelties of reality and society, but at
                the same time to develop long lasting relationships with total strangers regardless of where people came from or what they
                look like. I think that's pretty beautiful. 
            </p>

                <h5>
                    Conclusion:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Even if you don't get all the 80s' triva, it is with full confidence that Ready Player One is a must-read for any reader.
                    It highlights the insecurities in all of us, and how we use computers, the internet, and tech to develop the friendships
                    and relationships that will stick with us for a lifetime to overcome those insecurities. A tribute to 80s' culture, 
                    societal culture, and all humanities' culture, gives this book a 10/10. I will miss these new friends of mine, and the book will 
                    always be a anchor when I need it in my life to tell me our oddities are what make each and every one of us so special.

                Thank you Joshua, James
