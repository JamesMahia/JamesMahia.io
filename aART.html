                After graduating from NYU, April May is struggling making rent as a graphic designer in New York City. Struggling to make end's meet, relationship issues with her girlfriend and very soon to be ex Maya, and just overall just trying to not dissapoint her parents her life is anything but stable. That was until she was walking with her friend Andy Skampt and see a giant statue on a street corner. Andy and April being amateur reporters record a video reporting on this strange statue and upload it to YouTube. Little do they know, the world will never be the same again. What are these statues? Why are they appearing all over the world? Are the extra-terestrial, or just some elaborate hoax? What do they want with April? Do they want anything at all with her? This daring ride will have you realzing that once you pick it up, you'll be yelling 'Don't stop us now' all the way through *wink*

            <h5>
                Analysis (Spoilers):
            </h5>
            <p>
                While my summary might seem very chilling, the book is actually not as scary as it seems. It actually is one of the most funny yet thought provoking books I have ever read. The best way I can describe it is as weird and wacky as Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy, yet with a dash of the quirkiness of Hank Green. That is also something that really suprised me too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You might know Hank Green as the guy who made VidCon, or the person who made 2D glasses, or most famously the guy who made Crash Course and made all those chemistry videos. You may also know John Green, the priest-in-training turned best selling YA author (and now giant advocate of ending Tuberculosis), who is also his brother. When I learned that Hank Green was writing the book, I had a hard time of recognizing him as 'Bill Nye The Chem Guy', but Hank Green shows much of his personality through his work even if you do not know what he does outside of the book. There are many hints from Queen Songs and Chemistry, both giant things Hank Green openly nerds about in the book and I love it. I did not like chemistry in high school, but man did this book make it look so interesting. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact he wrote the book so well that it is labeled as a GoodReads' Choice Award, Nominee for Favorite Fiction, and Nominee for Readers' Favorite Debut Author. One of the reasons why I am so impressed with the former scientists' writing was simply because of the characters. The supporting cast is very memorable and very level headed, a "good" contrast to April May. I say "good" in quotes because April May slowly becomes narcarssistic, trying to capitalize as much fame and wealth after her Carl video went viral as people suspect the Carls (the name April randomly gave to the statues) as Aliens as they appear all across the world, and it just so happens that April and Andy captured the first siting. That is until Peter Petrawicki - an equally famous radio personality - starts to create a group known as "The Defenders" who equally take advantage of the hype, and frame the Carls as a threat to humanity. So Andy, April, a scientist April finds named Miranda, PR agent Jennifer, and her own agent Robin need to solve all these mysteries together despite the fact they all don't get along all that well - especially with April.

            <h5>
                April "May" be a perfectly flawed character 
            </h5>
            <p>
               April is not exactly a perfect character in a moral sense, but perfectly flawed. She is enamored by fame and does so much in the beggining to chase it to the point where her girlfriend breaks up with her, her relationship with her family dwindles, and even at one point is left to figure out the Carl mystery all by herself. I see her character as brillitantly flawed as we all want some sort of glory within our lives, and I may dare say I was once a clout chaser myself when I was younger. And Hank himself was a part of that life too, as he has claimed in multile invterviews there were many projects he would take on so 'people could just look at [him]'. And I think that April May through this flaw, and eventually motivation to stop her own and Peters' disinformation later on makes her redemption arc so much more memorable. 
            </p>
            <h5>
                Hilariously serious
            </h5>
            <p> 
                In additon, the book is very funny. Some ways in the form of diaologue, other times the epicaricacy of the characters. Some of the memorable moments were the dream sequences, where April puzzle solves her way to find the explanation of the Carls, the ways April needs to 'kill herself' to wake up from the dreams, the time where a hand literally pops off a Carl and that hand just becomes a reccurring and even noteable character later, and not to mention the pleathora of quotes you can just say out of context. 

                My favorite is when April is describing NYC and she describes it as " the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is barren."

                But just as equally funny as the book gets, it also is super thought provoking. Again, I like to think of it as the Hitchiker's Guide of the 21st century. It studies not only the double edge sword of fame, but also the role social media has in controlling the masses. Both April and Peter both are playing the same game of who can influence more, who can get more followers, who can control more power. It even goes to the point where April literally gets shot during a rally, and is 'killed' in a wherehouse fire during a live stream. I say 'killed' because the book ends on a cliffhanger, but the point still stands. Hank Green has been an influencer for decades and has seen both the good and ugly of this power, and this book demonstrates not only how people will do anything to chase the fame at the end of the rainbow, but also the fuel that is social media. A topic that has only become more prominent to this day in many aspects that are too much to count.

                <h5>
                    Conclusion:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    This book has pretty much anything I would want in a book to get me hooked. Suspense people will love the Carl mystery, comedy people would love the charming characters Hank Green has made to get their kicks, I can't think of anyone really who wouldn't like this book. I guess if you like non-fiction you aren't going to like this book? But all in all, a perfect book that perfectly tetters between hilarious comedy, suspenseful climaxes, memorable characters, and thought provoking themes on how we as a society treat and chase fame.
