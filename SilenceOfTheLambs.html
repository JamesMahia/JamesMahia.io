                    FBI Trainee Clarice Starling is tasked by her supervisor Jack Crawford to investigate the disappearances of women kidnapped by killer and kidnapper Buffalo Bill. He obtained the nicknamed by wearing the skin of his victims, and the same fate can happen after he is suspected of kidnapping a Senator Martin's daughter daughter. To probe into the mind of a killer, she is taked to interview another killer named Hannibal Lecter aka "Hannibal the Cannibal" who was serving time in prison. A seemingly simple task of intervewing a person of interest slowly burns into a high-stakes, high-intensity, seat gripping thriller which has semented itself in American pulp culture for over 35 years.

                <h5>
                    A Psychological Game of Chess
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Like many naive readers, I thought this book would be boring due to the seemingly boring nature of the constant interviews between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. These conversations take the bulk of the book and seemingly take away the intensity of the story. After all, Hannibal is behind bars while Clarice is talking to her so why should there be a cause of concern? That's where the book hooks you in. Deep down, the two characters play chess with each other mentally. Clarice obviously wants to know the psychology and methods Hannibal uses in his killings, and possible information about Buffalo Bill if he does in fact have a connection with him. And so she needs to methodically use her words to get the information she needs to save the Martin's daughter and barter with him and the prison guards what he wants, but not too much to not aide in a possible escape. 
                    </p>

                    What makes the book even more gripping is that Hannibal plays the same game too. He asks very personal questions about Clarice's life, scarring memories such as when Clarice as a child would witness the killing of lambs (hence the name being an analogy to the pure being killed and her drive to protect the innocent), and opening up about the death of her father who got killed trying to respond to a robberry as a deputy. This vulnerabilty is what Hannibal Lecter wants as lee way for him to get a few small luxuries in his cell, but also aides in climaxes which I will save for the spoiler part.

                    The point still stands, this mental boxing match between a very determined yet young FBI agent vs a the cold and calculated mind of a killer really drew me in. And right when everything seemed set and stone, everything goes haywire.

                <h5>
                    Gripping climaxes (spoilers)
                </h5>
                <p>
                    While being too grippped in the conversations, we still need to acknoledge that there is still a killer on the lose who may end the life of Catherine (the Senator's daughter). So the book throws you off guard with the the fact the time is ticking, which slowly creeps up on the reader. But when the ploy becomes more closer to finding where Buffalo Bill is, Hannibal escapes prison in the most brutal yet somehow oddly admireably cunning way possible by using a pen to unlock the cell door, kill the two guards watching him by cuffing them to the cell, and to my biggest shock and genuine horror skins the face and wears the clothes of one of the guards so the paramedics can take him away beleving he is one of the guards. I quite literally gasped in real life once I read that statement. 

                    I also gasped in reality a second time after reading the confrontation between Buffalo Bill and Clarice. For some reason my mind did not click that Clarice would one day confront Buffalo Bill, but when it did happen my heart stopped. But speaking of suspense, here is probably what everyone was waiting for.

                <h5>
                    Movie or book?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Ah yes. The Coke Vs. Pepsi, the Apple Vs. Microsoft, the age old debate, film vs book. Personally, I saw the movie years after I read the book, and I think both films do a great job in their own rights. The POV and face-centered shots amplified by the stellar acting of both Jodie Forester and Anthony Hopkins made such a gripping film. In fact, Jodie Forester said in an interview once that she would avoid Hopkins saying that he didn't seem to like people - especially her. By near the end of the shoot, she managed toe courage to strike a conversation. Suprsingly, Hopkins was very friendly and said "Really? I did not want to talk to you because I thought you were scared of me!" I think that exchange kind of brings out how good the acting was in the film because even the actors were getting scared of each other. Yet in my view, the book does the suspense and shock value better - but that is simply due to the nature of reading. When reading books, the mind unlocks imagination, which amplifies both wonder and fear. So when I saw the movie, everything was just in front of me and I did not go through the adventure that is imagination through putting the energy into reading. But perhaps that could be attributed to the fact I read the book first.

                <h5>
                    Conclusion
                </h5>

                <p>
                    To this day, I fondly remember Silence of The Lambs for its' beautiful yet terryfing writing. All from the suspense of both trying to find Buffalo Bill to being put in the shoes of Clarice interviewing a cold and calculated cannibal, Harris does not fail to dissapoint in his American staple. In fact after finishing, I went back to the store and bought Hannibal and Red Dragon (the sequel and the prequel respectivley). Into a book pushing you to the end of your seat? Would highly reccomend Silence of The Lambs.
